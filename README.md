## Multi-purpose charger
### Abstract
 In daily life, the charger is very commonly used, so in order to meet the needs of daily life, the design of a multi-voltage charging circuit charger. This charger is based on the RS bistable trigger composed of 555-hour base circuit, and finally constitutes the circuit schematic diagram of the multi-purpose charger. The charger can charge 4 nickel-metal hydride or nickel-cadmium batteries, 4V or 6V lead-acid batteries. The main components of the charger include rectifier filter circuit, voltage regulator circuit, charging control circuit, charging voltage setting circuit, charging indicator circuit and so on.

## 8×8 LED display based on 51 MCU
### Abstract
 The P0 port of 51 MCU is connected to 74LS245 as the row driver controlling the 8×8 LED lattice screen. The column selection is controlled by port P1. When the program is running, the words "大", "工", "N", "O" and "1" are displayed in turn on the 8×8 LED lattice screen.
